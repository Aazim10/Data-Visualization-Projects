Movie Genre Analysis and Visualization
Steps to Complete the Project:
1. Data Collection:
   Obtain a dataset containing movie information. You can use datasets from sources like Kaggle, IMDb, or other movie-related databases.
   Make sure the dataset includes attributes like movie title, release year, genre(s), and ratings.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency. Perform any necessary data transformations to prepare the data for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   Use Pandas to explore the dataset and gain insights into movie genres, release years, and ratings. 
   Calculate summary statistics, such as the average rating for each genre and the distribution of movies across different years.

4. Data Visualization:
   Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a variety of visualizations:

   - Genre Distribution: Create a bar chart that shows the distribution of movies across different genres. This will help you identify the most common genres.

   - Genre Popularity Over Time: Plot a line chart or area chart to visualize how the popularity of different genres has changed over the years. 
     This can help you identify trends and shifts in audience preferences.

   - Average Rating by Genre: Create a bar chart or box plot to display the average ratings for each genre. This will give insights into which genres tend to have higher or lower ratings.

   - Correlation Heatmap: Generate a correlation heatmap using Seaborn to visualize the correlations between attributes like ratings and release years. 
     This can help you identify relationships between variables.

   - Top Movies by Genre: Create a horizontal bar chart showcasing the top-rated movies for each genre. This will highlight the most acclaimed movies within each genre.
